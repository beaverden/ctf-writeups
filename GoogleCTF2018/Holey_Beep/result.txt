The Pittsburgh Engineer’s Cake (This is the maximum of the final Gaussian Process model, trained
on all the Pittsburgh Trials, including transfer learning.)

    Mix together flour, baking soda, and cayenne pepper. Then, mix the sugar, egg, butter (near refrigerator
temperature), and other ingredients until nearly smooth; it takes about 2 minutes in a counter-top stand mixer
with a flat paddle blade. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until the dough is uniform; do not over-mix. Spoon
out onto parchment paper (we used a #40 scoop, 24 milliliters), and bake for 14 minutes at 175C (350?
F).
