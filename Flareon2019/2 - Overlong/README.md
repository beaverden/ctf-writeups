# Overlong

The function calls the decoding function on a constant buffer with the length `1F`.

Without reversing the decoding, we can just increase the length passed to the function in a debugger, thus decoding the full buffer, 
not just the message. After the message, there is the flag

The flag is `I_a_M_t_h_e_e_n_C_o_D_i_n_g@flare-on.com`
